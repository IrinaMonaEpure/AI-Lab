    "# Movie Recommender System for Groups of People\n",
    "\n",
    "Most movie streaming websites nowadays use recommender systems in order to cater to their user's needs. But what do you do when you want to watch a movie with your group of friends? It seems like an impossible task since such websites only take into account one user's personal preferences when trying to predict how much they'll like a certain movie. But I believe there is a solution to make streaming services more accomodating to group viewings.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The algorithm K Nearest Neighbors is commonly used in order to predict a person's preferences based on previous activity, by using data provided by other users. A User-User collaborative filtering model based on K-NN could be improved to include preferences from multiple people when making a prediction for that whole group. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Presuming each user has a dataset of ratings (from 1.0 to 5.0) for the movies they have watched, a good starting point would be to create a new dataset containing as ratings the averages of the ratings given by the group members. This could be obtained automatically if the respective streaming website offered to users a feature such as \"watch with friends\", which would allow a user to select the friends they are watching with (as long as they also have accounts on that website) in order to merge their datasets. Since it's very likely that there are movies that only a part of the group has watched, the average should be computed as follows:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "average_rating = sum_of_ratings_from_group_members/number_of_group_members_that_have_watched_the_movie.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Some additional changes could be made to improve the algorithm further. For example, movies for which any individual group member would normally have a very low predicted appreciation could be automatically eliminated from the list of suggestions for the group.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Taking into consideration the popularity of online streaming services and the enjoyment that people get from watching movies and series together, I think this idea is a very potentially useful one.\n",
