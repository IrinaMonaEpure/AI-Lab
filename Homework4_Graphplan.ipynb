    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this homework is to become familiar with and implement the construction of a planning algorithm, Graphplan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The planning graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The planning graph is a structure that comes to the aid of a planning algorithm to determine what actions can be performed at a given time and what are the possible simultaneous actions and the possible conflicts between these actions and facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The planning graph is an acyclic oriented graph that is organized into alternate state/action levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first level has facts (or denials of them) as nodes, and these have no entry edges. The next level has actions as nodes and contains all the actions that could be performed given the facts on the first level. The third level contains, as nodes, the facts that could result from the actions on the second level, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each level, there may be mutual exclusion relationships (mutex) between nodes, in the sense that the two nodes could not exist / could not be achieved at the same time.\n",
    "\n",

    "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Russel & Norvig), 11.4 Chapter (395-402)\n",
    "http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/2nd-ed/newchap11.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use for the representation of a fact (positive or negative literal) a string that represents the whole literal. Negative literals will begin with `NOT_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions will also be represented as strings. We will represent the special action of keeping a literal (*persistence actions*) as `____ P`, where` P` is the representation of the literal. E.g. `____ EatenCake`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent a list of mutual exclusions, we will use a list of pairs of actions or literals, where two actions (or two literals) will appear only once in the list. To avoid the dependence on the order, the `isMutex` function will be used to easily see whether or not a pair already exists in the list of mutual exclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will represent the graph as a list of levels (alternative status and action levels), where a level is a dictionary containing three keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A status level contains:\n",
    "  * `type` key with `state` value;\n",
    "  * the `state` key having as value a list of literals;\n",
    "  * `mutex` key with a value of a list of mutually exclusive literal pairs.\n",
    "* An action level contains:\n",
    "  * `type` key with the value `actions`;\n",
    "  * the `actions` key having as value a list of actions;\n",
    "  * `mutex` key, with a value of a list of exclusive share pairs."
