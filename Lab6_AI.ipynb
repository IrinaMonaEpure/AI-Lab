    "Hello! Thank you so much for your help during the lab. I really appreciate you helping us out more. My code doesn't run properly, but I tried to at least show my way of thinking. I would have spent more time on it, but I'm running out of time now. I think I had a hard time with it because I didn't really understand how to use class Board. Also, there was no way for me to check my functions and classes along the way to see if they work well or not. Could you please share your solution with us after the deadline? Or show it to us at the lab?\n",
