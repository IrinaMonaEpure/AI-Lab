    "\n",
    "The purpose of this laboratory is to understand the concepts related to semantic networks and to implement simple mechanisms for determining the attributes of objects in a semantic network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes, attributes, objects\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider that any **object** can belong to a **class**. This association is described by the relation $ Object \\xrightarrow{isa} Class $. We will represent this relation by an instance of the predicate $ isa $, in the form $ isa (Object, Class) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "One class can **inherit** another class (it is a sub-type). This relationship is called A-Kind-Of and is described as $ Subclass \\xrightarrow{ako} Class $. We will represent this relation by an instance of the predicate $ ako $, in the form $ ako (Subclass, Class) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class can have **attributes** that have **values**. We represent that a class $ Class $ has the attribute $ Atr $ with the value $ val $ as an atom $ Atr (Class, value) $. The same will be for an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes are inherited from a class to a subclass of it and from the class to the object (instance). To determine what the value of an attribute might be for a particular object, we need to go up (to superclasses) on the $ isa $ and $ ako $ relations to find the first (closest) definition of the value of that attribute, in an ancestor of the object class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will represent a semantic network as a knowledge base containing exclusively atoms. The predicates will be $ isa $, $ ako $, and the predicates corresponding to the various attributes."

    "1. Most cars, but not all, are powered by an internal combustion engine (ICE).\n",
    "2. An ICE provides a typical car with about 110 HP.\n",
    "3. A hybrid car is a car that has an ICE and an electric motor.\n",
    "4. There are two categorizations for hybrid cars:\n",
    "5. you can have parallel versus series hybrids;\n",
    "6. and you can have mild versus full hybrids.\n",
    "7. A hybrid would typically provide 100HP from the ICE and 30HP from the electric motor.\n",
    "8. Some cars can be assisted by a low power electric motor (about 20HP).\n",
    "9. A mild hybrid is a hybrid that has an ICE assisted by such a low power electric motor.\n",
    "10. An electric car is considered to be able to be powered by electric power alone.\n",
    "11. Electric cars have about 120HP, and no ICE.\n",
    "12. A full hybrid can be powered only by its electric motor, so it could be considered a kind of electric car.\n",
    "13. Full hybrids feature electric motors of about 100HP.\n",
    "14. The Toyota Prius is a full and parallel hybrid.\n",
    "15. The Honda Insight is a mild parallel hybrid.\n",
    "16. The Chevrolet Volt is a full, series hybrid.\n",

I just don't want you to take away from this that we don't like you or that we aren't interested in this class. We all want to learn and I think people's frustrations built up over not being able to solve things on their own or with some help from you and then using web resources and getting a 0, as well as being afraid that getting bad grades on labs or homeworks in this class could mean not being allowed to take the exam and, consequently, not getting their diploma this year. No one dislikes you, they're just afraid of failing!\n",
